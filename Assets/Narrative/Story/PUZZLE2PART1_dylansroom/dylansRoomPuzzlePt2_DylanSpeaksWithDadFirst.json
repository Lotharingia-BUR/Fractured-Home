Why are you here?\"","\n","^Dylan: \"Well, this is my room.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"...\"","\n","^Dylan: \"...Do you wanna talk?\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"No, it's fine. You're a kid, it's nothing you should be worrying about.\"","\n","^Dylan: \"But you're my dad, and I see that you're stressed out about something. I want to help if I can, even if it's just listening. And I do want to know.\"","\n","^For a moment, the ghost's expression moves. A flash of pain crosses his eyes and he looks resigned, but you can't help but miss the smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.","\n","^Dylan's father: \"Hah, when did you get so grown up? I should be the one saying that to you. But yes...we can talk. I'll do my best to answer.\"","\n","^Dylan: \"Why did you guys fight so much over the permission slip? In retrospect, it wasn't that serious.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"No, it was. We didn't know you had a field trip until that day your mom picked you up early from school.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"And in terms of when things started falling out between your mom and I, it was never because of this one incident with the permission slip...","\n","^...It was a lot of small and big things that built up over time.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"There was a point I got too busy worrying over the menial things of what kept our family together.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"Money lets our family live well, but what makes a family is the people. You, my son, and mom.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"I was angry because we could've prevented this anguish if we hadn't lost sight of that.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"We took our frustration out on each other instead of voicing our schedules and working together to find ways to compromise and make things easier for each other.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"We never wanted to create a space where you felt like you couldn't come to us for anything. I'm sorry.\"","\n","^Dylan: \"...I'm grateful you guys worked hard, I know we didn't have a lot. I wish... I had the courage back then to speak up, but I was scared. I didn't want to be a burden.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"Dylan, you'll never be a burden to us, and I'm really proud you took the chance to say something earlier. Speaking up is one of those things that's a lot easier said than done.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"Speaking of which, why don't you look over there on your shelf? I've been meaning to give that to you.\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"It's a souvenir I bought for you after you missed that trip. I...never really found the right time to give it to you, but there's no time like the present! Right?\"","\n","^Dylan's father: \"Though, I'd imagine since it's  been a while, it might need a fresh set of batteries.\"","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
