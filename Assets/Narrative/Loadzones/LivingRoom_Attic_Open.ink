You look out at the old tree you used to climb. It was such a good way to get into the attic where you and mom used to go play games. She always scolded you for climbing the tree to get there though.

You open up the window and climb through, casper close behind. 

You scramble up the side of the tree, the pattern up burned into your mind as you reach the attic window

    -> END
